# **RAG-GenAI**

**RAG-GenAI** is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to redefine the boundaries of generative AI by combining state-of-the-art document retrieval techniques with **natural language processing** (NLP). It leverages cutting-edge tools like **NLTK**, **rouge-score**, and **sentence-transformers** to ensure precise, contextually enriched, and factually grounded responses for diverse applications.


## üöÄ Overview
Generative AI models often face challenges such as:

‚Ä¢ Generating hallucinated information. 

‚Ä¢ Providing outdated or irrelevant data.

‚Ä¢ Lacking integration with real-time or custom knowledge bases.

RAG-GenAI overcomes these barriers by fusing retrieval pipelines with the generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), creating outputs that are factually accurate and context-aware.

# Key Technologies

‚Ä¢ **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Used for tokenization,      stemming, and linguistic preprocessing, enhancing text parsing and content understanding.

‚Ä¢ **Rouge-Score**: Implements robust evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated responses against reference texts.

‚Ä¢ **Sentence-Transformers**: Enables semantic similarity and vector-based document retrieval, ensuring the most contextually relevant information is retrieved.

‚Ä¢ **TF-IDF & BM25**: Incorporates traditional retrieval methods to augment dense embeddings with keyword-based relevance.

‚Ä¢ **Pretrained Models**: Utilizes cutting-edge models like BERT, DistilBERT, and GPT variants for retrieval and generation tasks.

‚Ä¢ **PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers**: Frameworks supporting the modular design and fine-tuning of both retrieval and generative models.
## ‚ú® Features
‚Ä¢ **Hybrid Document Retrieval**: Combines dense vector embeddings (via sentence-transformers) with traditional TF-IDF and BM25 for optimal results.

‚Ä¢ **Customizable Pipelines**: Fine-tune retrieval and generation processes for domain-specific use cases.

‚Ä¢ **Quality Assurance**: Includes metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR for evaluating the precision and coherence of generated outputs.

‚Ä¢ **Plug-and-Play Design**: Easily integrate your custom datasets and models with minimal effort.
## üîß Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/STiFLeR7/RAG-GenAI.git ```

```cd RAG-GenAI```

2. Install Dependencies
```pip install -r requirements.txt  ```
## üìö Usage
**Step 1: Configure Retrieval and Generation**

Modify the ```config.py``` file to specify:

‚Ä¢ Data source paths.

‚Ä¢ Retrieval models (e.g., sentence-transformers or BM25).

‚Ä¢ Generative models (e.g., GPT-3, LLaMA, or T5).

**Step 2: Prepare the Document Corpus**

Ensure your document repository is structured and preprocessed using NLTK for tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

**Step 3: Run the Main Script**

Launch the system to process queries and generate responses:

```python main.py```
## üß† Model Workflow

**1.** **Query Processing:**

‚Ä¢ Tokenized and processed using NLTK to extract key phrases and improve retrieval accuracy.

**2. Document Retrieval:**

‚Ä¢ Uses sentence-transformers to perform dense vector searches.

‚Ä¢ Supplements with BM25 or TF-IDF for hybrid retrieval.

**3. Response Generation:**

‚Ä¢ Inputs retrieved documents into the generative model.

‚Ä¢ Produces responses with contextual relevance and factual grounding.

**4. Evaluation:**

‚Ä¢ Evaluates the quality of responses using metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR.
## Training Summary

‚Ä¢ **Training Loss:** ~0.272

‚Ä¢ **Evaluation Loss:** ~0.383

‚Ä¢ **Runtime:**

 ‚Ä¢ Training: 3 hours, 25 minutes

 ‚Ä¢ Evaluation: 212 seconds (~3.5 minutes)
## üåü Evaluation
### Metrics Used:

‚Ä¢ **ROUGE-Score**: Measures overlap between generated and reference texts.

‚Ä¢ **BLEU**: Evaluates the n-gram precision of generated content.

‚Ä¢ **METEOR**: Assesses linguistic diversity and synonym-based matching.

These metrics ensure high-quality responses, improving both fluency and informativeness.
